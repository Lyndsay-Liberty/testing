This was a early project that I peice mealed together, jumping between CSS and HTML with no rhyme or reason. This is probably why it is such a mess. I have stop trying to update it because eveytime I try I end up breaking something I wanted to keep. This project probably needs to be scraped. I could benefit from a flex template so I can see it in action to get the reinforcement but I simply ran out of time.
